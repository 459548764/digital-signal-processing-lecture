# Digital Signal Processing

This repository contains a collection of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks discussing various topics of [Digital Signal Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing). The notebooks provide an introduction into the foundations of spectral analysis, random signals, quantization and filtering. A basic understanding of discrete signals and systems is assumed. See [index.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture/blob/master/index.ipynb) for an overview on the available topics. The theory is accompanied by computational examples written in [IPython 3](http://ipython.org/). The examples are best explored in an interactive manner. The notebooks constitute the lecture notes to the masters course [Digital Signal Processing](http://www.int.uni-rostock.de/Digitale-Signalverarbeitung.48.0.html) read by [Sascha Spors](http://www.int.uni-rostock.de/Staff-Info.23+B6JmNIYXNoPWUxOTliMTNjY2U2MDcyZjJiZTI0YTc4MmFkYTE5NjQzJnR4X2pwc3RhZmZfcGkxJTVCYmFja0lkJTVEPTMmdHhfanBzdGFmZl9waTElNUJzaG93VWlkJTVEPTExMQ__.0.html), Institute of Communications Engineering, Universit√§t Rostock.

You can give the repository a [Star](https://github.com/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture/stargazers) if you like the notebooks. You are invited to contribute by reporting errors and suggestions as [issues](https://github.com/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture/issues) or directly via <mailto:Sascha.Spors@uni-rostock.de>. I am also looking forward to new examples or topics. The long term vision is a community driven knowledge base for the foundations and applications of Digital Signal Processing.


## Getting Started

The Jupyter notebooks are available

* Online as [static web pages](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture/blob/master/index.ipynb)
* Online for [interactive use](http://mybinder.org/repo/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture) using [binder](http://mybinder.org/)
* Local (offline) use on your computer 

The local use on your computer requires a local Jupyter/IPython installation. The [Anaconda distribtution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) provides a good starting point. You have to [download or clone the notebooks from Github](http://github.com/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture). Use a [Git](http://git-scm.org/) client to clone the notebooks and then start your local Jupyter server. For manual installation of Jupyter under OS X/Linux please refer to your packet manager.
