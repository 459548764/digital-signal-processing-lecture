# Digital Signal Processing

This repository contains the lecture notes to the masters course [Digital Signal Processing](http://www.int.uni-rostock.de/Digitale-Signalverarbeitung.48.0.html), [Institute of Communications Engineering](http://www.int.uni-rostock.de/), Universit√§t Rostock. The notes are provided in the form of [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks using Python 3. Please direct questions and suggestions to <mailto:Sascha.Spors@uni-rostock.de>.

## Getting Started

The jupyter notebooks for are available as [static web pages](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture/), as well as for interactive use with [IPython 3](http://ipython.org/). For the latter they have to be [downloaded from Github](http://github.com/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture).

Use [Git](http://git-scm.org/) to download the files and then start the IPython notebook:

    git clone https://github.com/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture.git
    cd digital-signal-processing-lecture
    ipython3 notebook
    
This will open a new view in your web browser with a list of notebooks. Click on [index.ipynb](index.ipynb) (or any of the other available notebooks).

Alternatively, you can also download individual notebook files (with the extension `.ipynb`) and open them in IPython.
Note that some notebooks make use of additional files (audio files etc.) which you'll then also have to download manually.
