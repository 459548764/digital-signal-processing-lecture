# Digital Signal Processing

This repository contains the lecture notes to the masters course [Digital Signal Processing](http://www.int.uni-rostock.de/Digitale-Signalverarbeitung.48.0.html), [Institute of Communications Engineering](http://www.int.uni-rostock.de/), Universit√§t Rostock. The notes are provided in the form of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks using IPython 3. This content is provided as [Open Educational Resource](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Educational_Resources) (ORE).

The lecture notes are under heavy development. New units will be added throughout the winter 2015/16. Feel free to contact me if you find errors, or have questions and suggestions via <mailto:Sascha.Spors@uni-rostock.de>. 

## Getting Started

The jupyter notebooks are available

* Online as [static web pages](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture/blob/master/index.ipynb)
* Online for [interactive use](http://mybinder.org/repo/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture)
* Local use on your computer

For local use on your computer, e.g. for the exercises, you have to [download the notebooks from Github](http://github.com/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture). Use [Git](http://git-scm.org/) to download the files and then start the IPython notebook:

    git clone https://github.com/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture.git
    cd digital-signal-processing-lecture
    ipython3 notebook
    
This will open a new view in your web browser with a list of notebooks. Click on [index.ipynb](index.ipynb) (or any of the other available notebooks). Alternatively, you can also download individual notebook files (with the extension `.ipynb`) and open them in IPython. Note that some notebooks make use of additional files (audio files etc.) which you'll then also have to download manually.
