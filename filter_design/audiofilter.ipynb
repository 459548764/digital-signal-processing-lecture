    "\n",
    "We recollect the most common analog transfer functions (Laplace domain) of 1st and 2nd order IIR audio filters and derive bilinear transforms (transfer functions in z-domain), applying prewarping for cut/mid frequency and for quality/bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in a Matlab based implementation of these filters, please have a look at the TU Berlin project [AKTools](https://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/publications/open_research_tools/aktools/), cf. Fabian Brinkmann, Stefan Weinzierl: \"AKtools -- An Open Software Toolbox for Signal Acquisition, Processing, and Inspection in Acoustics.\" In: *142nd AES Convention, Berlin, Germany, 2017*, e-Brief 309.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although more sophisticated filter designs exist, the discussed filter characteristics solve many IIR based audio filtering tasks, such as in a typical digital audio workstation (DAW) and available [plugins](https://plugins.iem.at/), in digital mixing consoles, loudspeaker management systems, power amplifiers with DSP capabilities and audio player software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher order IIR filters can be built from second order filters. A series connection of the discussed filter types achieves more complex transfer functions often being used in the mentioned applications. A so called graphical equalizer is a prominent example for that, which is however not restricted to build from series connection."

    "In audio signal processing also IIR filters of higher order are applied. However, they will be usually split into second order sections for series connection. Note that the group delay of an IIR filter increases with higher filter order. \n",
    "\n",
    "A prominent example of using higher order IIR filters is found in loudspeaker design. For a multi-way loudspeaker each driver must only be driven within an appropriate intended frequency range. This is usually realized with a bandpass filter that is built from a higher order lowpass and a higher order highpass filter. Thus, each loudspeaker exhibits its own bandpass filter. The acoustic summation of all driver's generated sound pressure then yields the desired full audio bandwidth.\n",
